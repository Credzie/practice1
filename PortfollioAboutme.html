    <p>
        Me as a Person is a Big old Nerd that not only likes the Normal day to day Tech or Games that people of the world partake in 
        but also likes delving into the Competitive side of Programming and Gaming 
        and often found myself engorged in PVP Games or NFT trading and Crypto Mining. 
        This has made me commit to the belief that 
        “If I like using Computer Programs and Games to this extent then why not make it a profession?”  

 

        So, i Decided to take up courses in IT development and 
        Completed Lv2 Diploma in Digital and IT skills from JustIT September 2023- October 2023 and a LV3 Software Development Bootcamp.
         I also plan to Enter into a LV 4 course or apprenticeship to help me further my skills and experience in the IT Work Sector.
