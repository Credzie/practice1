        <h1>ABOUT ME: JASON C. UMEYOR</h1>
        <p>Anyone that Knows me well knows that I have a Big Affinity  

            for the Technological Arts especially in Programming and Games Software Development  

            and even though my journey into gaining the skills needed to Develop Games and other complex programs.  

            From An Early Age I have always had a big interest in technology especially with the games, 

            and as the years went on and I have tried other career paths I always found my comfort zone in technology, 

            working on new games and projects, try out new tech and programs 

            and keeping UpToDate with latest News about future Technology that will be introduced into the economy.  
        </p>

            Me as a Person is a Big old Nerd that not only likes the Normal day to day Tech or Games that people of the world partake in  

            but also likes delving into the Competitive side of Programming and Gaming  

            and often found engorged in PVP Games or NFT trading and Crypto Mining.  

            This has made me commit to the belief that  

            “If I like using Computer Programs and Games to this extent then why not make it a profession?”   

            So, I Decided to take up courses in IT development and  

            Completed Lv2 Diploma in Digital and IT skills from Just IT September 2023- October 2023 and a LV3 Software Development Bootcamp. 

            I also plan to Enter into a LV 4 course or apprenticeship to help me further my skills and experience in the IT Work Sector.
