select * from Member where mlocation='London';
-- 2. All cars registered with the company e.g. all Nissan cars. 
select * from Vehicle where vehMake='Audi';
-- 3. The number of engineers that work for the company. 
select count(*) from carshop.engineer;
-- 4. The number of members registered. 
select count(*) from carshop.Member;
-- 5. All the breakdown after a particular date 
select count(*) from carshop.breakdown where breakdowwnDate > '2024-02-04' ;
-- 6. All the breakdown between 2 dates 
select count(*) from carshop.breakdown where breakdowwnDate between '2024-02-04' and '2024-07-09' ;
-- 7. The number of time a particular vehicle has broken down 
select count(*) from carshop.breakdown where vehReg='duyir';
-- 8. The number of vehicles broken down more than once 
select count(*) from carshop.breakdown where vehReg > 1 ;
select vehReg, count(*) AS 'No of BD' from Breakdown

-- Task 2 --
-- 1. All the vehicles a member owns. 
select concat(Member.mFname,'',Member.mLname) AS 'Owner', Vehicle. * FROM Vehicle  INNER JOIN Member
ON Vehicle.MemberID=Member.MemberID;
-- 2. The number of vehicles for each member in descending order. 
select concat(Member.mFname,'',Member.mLname) AS 'Owner', group_concat(vehModel) AS 'Model Owned' FROM Vehicle INNER JOIN Member
ON Vehicle.MemberID=Member.MemberID GROUP BY Vehicle.MemberID;
-- 3. All vehicles that have broken down in a particular location along with member details. 
select  Vehicle. * from Breakdown  left join Vehicle on Breakdown.vehReg=Vehicle.vehReg left join Member on Vehicle.vehReg=Member.memberID where breakdownLocation='London';
-- 4. A list of all breakdown along with member and engineer details between two dates.
